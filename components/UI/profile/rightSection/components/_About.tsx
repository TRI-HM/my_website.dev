      <p>
        Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer nearly 8 years ago,
        I&#39;ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and
        collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both
        business and consumer use. I&#39;m quietly confident, naturally curious, and
        perpetually working on improving my chopsone design problem at a time.
